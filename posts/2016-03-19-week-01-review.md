##What did you learn last week? Make a list.
* styling guide
* method documentation
* readibility
* using terminal
* shortcuts on mac
* multiple desktops
* github
* frequent commits
* working locally
* in ruby, comprehension is more important than saving characters or ease of typing
* naming conventions
* methods should do 1 thing only
* nil and false evaluate falsy & everything else truthy
* using pry
* loops <= 2 layers deep
* refactoring
* testing:
	* test 1 thing
	* test for happy path
	* test for various failures
* decomposing problems:
	* top-down : big then breakdown
	* bottom-up : bunch of little parts that build up
* flow charts
	* open circle : start/end
	* open rextangle : some operation
	* open diamond : conditional logic
* avoid using floats always
	* ex. 43.21 dollars can become 4321 cents
* save numbers as strings unless you need to for calculation
* when testing test 2 different paths to same expected result
	* make sure you are testing the logic not whether your test == your test

 ##What things came hard? What do you still struggle with?
* Test driven development was difficult, or at least uncomfortable, and will probably still be until I can get in the habit. 
* Breaking things down into little chunks with refactoring and style guidelines.
* Remembering that the things you are writing aren't just for you to understand and make work right now, but for future reference by maybe yourself or others, so taking the time to be more explicit that you might otherwise be is definitely new, but becoming more comfortable.
* Learning all of the syntax definitely is something I am still struggling with, but obviously the more you do the little bit easier it becomes.


 ##How are you feeling? How are you doing?
 * I'm tired but excited about the things we are learning and the challenges and problem solving and the "win" you feel when you make things work.
 * I feel good about the pace of learning and the time I'm putting in outside of class on my projects. I think I'm doing fine on my end with the studying part.
