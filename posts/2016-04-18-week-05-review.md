##How are you doing? How are you feeling? What do you know now that you didn't know last week?
- I was pretty stressed out this weekend. I got the dropdowns and checkboxes to show up, but then associating them with getting created and patched was a different situation.

- I am more comfortable with using pry to troubleshoot, although not anywhere near as comfortable as I'd like to be.

##  What questions do you still have?
- Branches - I am having trouble with the branching. I think I start a checkout and think I am going to come back to it later and then of course it isn't updated all the way because changes have been merged with the master inbetween the time I originally created that branch and then when i try to use it again.

## Many-to-many
- The forms are the updating are confusing for me and I feel like I really don't know what's going on.


## In terms of process, what would you do the same next time? What would you do differently?

- I think I started planning the project in a way that made sense and helped a lot, but then I tried dividing it into tasks based on what I knew and what I didn't know (mainly 1:m and m:m and the forms and routes for those) and that ended up being pretty confusing in terms of tracking where changes and updates should then be places.

- I kind of wished that I would have started at a more basic level, only doing 3 models and the specific relationships required and then really fully developed those and reflected on that before moving on with additional attributes and relationships.

- waffle to plan and track

## How does this project line up with your expectations of your own work at this time?

- I thought I should have been able to have completed all routes and I didn't. I feel like I get stuck and kind of flail for answers and then often find the fix but often don't really understand why what I did works.
