## Pros of using a framework

- Efficiency
Tasks that usually would take you hours and hundreds of lines of code to write, can now be done in minutes with pre-built functions. Development becomes a lot easier, so if it’s easier it’s faster, and consequently efficient.

- Security
A widely used framework has big security implementations. The big advantage is the community behind it, where users become long-term testers. If you find a vulnerability or a security hole, you can go to the framework’s website and let the team know so they can fix it.

- Cost
Most popular frameworks are free, and since it also helps the developer to code faster, the cost for the final client will be smaller.

- Support
As any other distributed tool, a framework usually comes with documentation, a support team, or big community forums where you can obtain quick answers.

## Cons of using a framework

- You learn the framework, not the language
I believe this to be the major problem. If you’re using a framework and you know very little about the language behind it, you will learn the framework and not the language itself. The way you code jQuery is different from the way you code javascript. Simple put, if you know jQuery, it doesn’t mean you know javascript.

- Limitation
The framework’s core behaviour can’t be modified, meaning that when you use a framework, you are forced to respect its limits and work the way it is required. Make sure you choose a framework that suits your needs.

- Code is public
Since the framework is available to everyone, it is also available to people with bad intentions. It can be studied in order to know how things work and to find flaws that can be used against you.
