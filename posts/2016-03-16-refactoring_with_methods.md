##What did you learn from the refactoring process?


##What did you see during the demo that you can do going forward?
Breaking down your longer method into smaller chunks.


##How did your approach differ from my approach?
I had a lot of else ifs originally and really was more focused on what was easier for me to immediately put and looked most concise rather than what was the easiest to read and follow later on.

##How were our approaches the same? 


##If you were to do this again, how would you approach it?##


##How did the demonstration of refactoring affect the way you went about solving your homework assignment?##

I think the refactoring approach makes it easier for me to start working on methods because I can kind of work the way it makes sense and then break things down to begin with, because I am now aware of that, or if it makes sense for solving the problem to push through my method with some things combined I can do that and then review to sort of filter through a working method and make it into more readile chunks.
